# Task - Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks

![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Procedure

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The designs are in JPG static format. The reason for this, as opposed to including Sketch (or other similar design software) files, is to help train the eye when developing. This will mean that I'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. replicating possible situations when working on real projects.

**This Task has been built using HTML and CSS**


## Giving feedback

The [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge has allowed me to put my newly learnt html and css skills to practice.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful to practice on.
